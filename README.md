# The "One Person, One Pillow" 

Large Screen Project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases detailed information about pillows and their materials.

One of the most critical features of this project is the ability for users to stand in front of the large screen device, take a photo to measure the curvature of their neck and shoulders, and then use this data to customize pillows with different materials tailored to their individual needs.
